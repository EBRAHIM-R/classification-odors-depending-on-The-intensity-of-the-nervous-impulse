# classification-odors-depending-on-The-intensity-of-the-nervous-impulse
In this project we have created a program in Python that classifies odors based on the intensity of the nerve impulse when a person smells each odor.

### datasets:
I collected data from specific sensors that measure the intensity of the nervous impulse when smelling a particular smell, I did the research process, collected the values, and built my own data set for four scents, with it worth mentioning that I can collect more data and develop the algorithms that I used in this project to be able to classify 250 different smells .
